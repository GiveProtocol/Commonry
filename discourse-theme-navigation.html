  ⚠️ DEPRECATED - Use docs/discourse-unified-theme.html instead

  This file has been superseded by the unified theme which provides:
  - Single header experience across Commonry and Discourse
  - Proper Discourse user menu/search/notifications integration
  - Dark/light mode support matching Commonry
  - Mobile responsive navigation
  - Modern Discourse JS API (apiInitializer)

  See: docs/discourse-unified-theme.html for installation instructions
